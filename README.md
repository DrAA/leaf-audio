# LEAF: a LEarnable Audio Frontend

**Disclaimer: this is not an official Google product.**

LEAF is a library that provides the implementation of the LEAF model as describe
in [our recent ICLR publication](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jM76BCb6F9m).
It provides a learnable alternative to Mel filterbanks while using a very small
number of parameters.
